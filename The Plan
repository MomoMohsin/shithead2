Project Planning and Initial Setup
1. Project Structure
Client (Frontend):
git
src/ directory containing:
components/ for Vue components like Card.vue, Hand.vue, Deck.vue, Player.vue, etc.
views/ for Vue pages like GameBoard.vue (main game interface).
router/ for Vue Router if having multiple routes/pages.
store/ for Vuex if state management is needed across components.
assets/ for static assets like images and styles.
Server (Backend):
Node.js project with:
server.js for initializing the server.
gameLogic.js for managing the game rules and player actions.
socketHandlers.js for managing WebSocket connections and communications.
Common:

Set up a package.json in both client and server directories with necessary dependencies.
2. Technology Stack
Frontend: Vue.js, Vuex for state management, Vue Router for navigation, and Socket.IO client.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js for server setup, and Socket.IO for real-time web socket communication.
Testing: Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Deployment: Use services like Heroku or DigitalOcean for the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend.
3. Development Tools
Version control: Git and GitHub for source control.
Code editors: VS Code or any preferred IDE with support for Vue and TypeScript.
DevOps: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
Steps to Develop the Application
1. Setup Vue Project with TypeScript
Create a new Vue project with Vue CLI or Vite and add TypeScript support.
bash
Copy code
vue create shithead-game
# Choose TypeScript, Router, Vuex, Linter
2. Develop Basic Game Components
Card Component (Card.vue): Displays a card. Props for rank and face visibility.
Hand Component (Hand.vue): Displays player's hand.
Deck Component (Deck.vue): Manages drawing and shuffling of cards.
Player Component (Player.vue): Displays player's info and integrates Hand.
GameBoard (GameBoard.vue): Main layout where the game happens.
3. Backend Setup
Initialize a new Node.js project and set up Socket.IO.
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io
Implement game logic handling connections, room management, and game state.
4. Socket.IO Integration for Real-Time Communication
Implement event handlers for game actions like playing a card, drawing from the deck, and updating game state.
Ensure that events are emitted and listened to both on client and server to reflect real-time game updates.
5. Testing and Debugging
Unit test components and game logic.
Use Vue Devtools and browser debugging tools to ensure the game works correctly.
Conduct playtests with friends to ensure the game flow is smooth and enjoyable.
6. Deployment
Deploy the backend to a Node.js compatible hosting service.
Deploy the frontend to a static site hosting service.
Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed and properly managed by the hosting provider.
7. Advanced Features (Optional)
Add user authentication to manage sessions.
Implement a lobby system for game setup.
Provide chat functionality during the game for player interaction.
