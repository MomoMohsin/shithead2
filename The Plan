Step 1: Define Components and Views
Given the rules and gameplay mechanics, let’s identify the necessary Vue components and backend services:

Frontend Components:

Card Component (Card.vue): Displays a single card. Props for rank, visible face, and whether it's clickable.
Hand Component (Hand.vue): Displays the player’s current hand. Interacts with Card components and emits events when cards are selected.
Deck Component (Deck.vue): Represents the draw pile and the active play area. Manages deck operations like shuffling and dealing.
Player Component (Player.vue): Displays each player's upcards and downcards, and handles player interactions.
GameBoard Component (GameBoard.vue): The main game interface. Arranges player and deck components and handles game state transitions.
Lobby Component (Lobby.vue): Manages game room creation, player matchmaking, and game initiation.
Backend Modules:

Game Logic (gameLogic.js): Handles the rules, card movements, and validations of the game.
Socket Handlers (socketHandlers.js): Manages WebSocket connections, broadcasts game state updates, and receives commands from clients.
Step 2: Setup Basic Game Mechanics
Card Initialization: Define a service that initializes a deck of cards with ranks and suits.
Game State: Structure a model to track the state of the game, including players’ hands, the deck, and the discard pile.
Step 3: Implement Core Gameplay Logic
Game Initialization: Implement logic to distribute cards among players — 3 downcards, 3 upcards, and 3 handcards per player.
Play Mechanics: Code the logic for playing cards, drawing from the deck, and special rules (e.g., playing deuces, handling quartets).
Turn Management: Develop a system to manage turns, including checking for the availability of valid moves and handling pass conditions.
Step 4: Integrate Real-time Multiplayer Features
WebSocket Setup: Configure Socket.IO on both frontend and backend for real-time communication.
Event Handling: Define and implement socket events for actions like card played, deck shuffled, and player joined.
Step 5: User Interface and Interactivity
UI Development: Create and style the Vue components using CSS/SCSS, ensuring responsiveness and intuitive interaction.
Dynamic Updates: Use Vue’s reactivity system to update the UI based on changes in the game state, driven by Socket.IO events.
Step 6: Testing and Validation
Unit Testing: Write tests for individual components and backend functions.
Integration Testing: Test the integrated frontend and backend to ensure that game logic and WebSocket communication work as expected.
End-to-End Testing: Simulate a full game with multiple players to test the user interface and real-time interactions.
Step 7: Deployment and Go-Live
Server Preparation: Deploy the backend on a suitable cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
Client Deployment: Deploy the frontend on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
Domain Configuration: Set up custom domains if needed and ensure WebSocket support is configured correctly on the server.
Step 8: Maintenance and Iterative Improvements
Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring to track the performance and usage of both frontend and backend.
User Feedback: Incorporate player feedback to refine game rules, UI/UX, and overall gameplay.
Step 9: Advanced Features (Optional)
Player Authentication: Implement a system for user registration and authentication.
Chat Functionality: Add a chat feature to allow players to communicate during the game.
Leaderboards or Scoring: Develop a scoring system or leaderboards to enhance competitive play.
